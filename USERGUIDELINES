Install XAMPP and Composer

Open CMD and type
composer
cd C:\XAMPP/htdocs/
composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel resume
php artisan serve

And then, copy and replace folder Public, Resources & Routes into C:\XAMPP/htdocs/resume 


After that, open again CMD and type
composer
cd C:\XAMPP/htdocs/
cd resume
php artisan serve
